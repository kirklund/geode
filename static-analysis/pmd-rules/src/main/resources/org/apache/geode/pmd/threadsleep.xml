    <rule name="AvoidThreadSleepRule"
          message="Tests must use GeodeAwaitility or similar awaiting instead of Thread.sleeps. Thread.sleep is not allowed."
          language="java"
          class="org.apache.geode.pmd.AvoidThreadSleepRule">
        <description>
            Geode does not allow Thread.sleep statements within the test code.

            If the use of Thread.sleep is necessary within a callback to simulate slow processing,
            you can annotate the statement with @AllowThreadSleep, and it will be ignored by this
            rule.
